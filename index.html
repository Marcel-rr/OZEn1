    <h1>Renewable Energy Resources</h1>
    <p>Renewable energy resources are sources of energy that can be replenished naturally over short periods of time. They are considered more sustainable and environmentally friendly compared to fossil fuels. Here are some common types of renewable energy resources:</p>
    
    <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
    <p>Solar energy is harnessed from the sun using solar panels. It is one of the most abundant and accessible forms of renewable energy.</p>
    
    <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
    <p>Wind energy is generated by converting wind currents into electricity using wind turbines. It is a clean and efficient source of power.</p>
    
    <h2>Hydropower</h2>
    <p>Hydropower, or hydroelectric power, is produced by capturing the energy from flowing water, typically using dams. It is a reliable and consistent source of energy.</p>
    
    <h2>Biomass Energy</h2>
    <p>Biomass energy is derived from organic materials such as plant and animal waste. It can be used for heating, electricity generation, and as fuel for vehicles.</p>
    
    <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
    <p>Geothermal energy is obtained by tapping into the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. It can be used for heating and electricity generation.</p>
